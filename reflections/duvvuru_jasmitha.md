**Summary:**  
ChatWise introduces a conversational AI system aimed at enhancing the cognitive wellbeing of older adults. The chatbot leverages large language models (LLMs) to sustain multi-turn, personalized conversations that cover a variety of topics relevant to users’ interests. Through short pilot trials, participants reported improved mental stimulation, reduced boredom, and greater enjoyment in routine interactions. The study demonstrated that structured conversations could function as light cognitive therapy while also offering companionship. However, the system focuses primarily on cognitive engagement and emotional stimulation, with limited attention to urgent health or safety scenarios.

**3 Insights Learned:**  
1. Daily structured dialogue can have tangible benefits for seniors’ memory and attention.  
2. Personalization (topics, hobbies, prior conversations) increases engagement and retention.  
3. Emotional tone and conversation flow are more impactful than technical complexity.  

**2 Limitations/Risks:**  
1. The study was conducted with a small group over a short period, limiting long-term conclusions.  
2. The system does not address critical health needs such as fall detection, distress signals, or caregiver escalation.  

**1 Concrete Idea for My Project:**  
Inspired by ChatWise, our project will integrate **personalized daily conversation prompts** (e.g., medication reminders, favorite music, or family updates) to support both cognitive activation and companionship. Unlike ChatWise, we extend this with **safety escalation protocols and caregiver alerts**, ensuring that the agent supports not just cognitive wellbeing but also physical safety and emergency response.  


## Paper 2: Qualitative Analysis of Conversational Chatbots to Alleviate Loneliness in Older Adults

Chen, H., Li, X., Zhang, Y., & Wang, S. (2024). Qualitative analysis of conversational chatbots to alleviate loneliness in older adults. *Healthcare, 12*(1), 62. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare12010062

**Summary:**  
This study explored how conversational chatbots can reduce loneliness among older adults by focusing on the emotional and affective quality of dialogue. Using qualitative interviews and prototype testing, the researchers found that seniors value warmth, empathy, and consistency in chatbot responses. Participants reported that emotionally supportive interactions made them feel less isolated, but frustrations arose when conversations were repetitive or mechanical. The authors emphasized the role of empathy in chatbot design, arguing that companionship must go beyond task completion to include genuine-seeming human connection. The findings establish loneliness reduction as a valid outcome for chatbot interventions but highlight risks of over-dependence.

**3 Insights Learned:**  
1. Warmth and empathy in dialogue are crucial to building trust and emotional comfort for seniors.  
2. A chatbot’s 24/7 availability provides reassurance and continuity, even if technically simple.  
3. Loneliness reduction is an important evaluation metric alongside usability or task success.  

**2 Limitations/Risks:**  
1. The qualitative study used a small sample, limiting generalizability across cultural and linguistic contexts.  
2. Without caregiver integration, seniors risk over-reliance on a purely digital companion.  

**1 Concrete Idea for My Project:**  
Building on Chen et al., our project incorporates an **empathetic dialogue style module** that generates warm, reassuring responses during routine conversations. To address the risk of over-dependence, we add **caregiver integration and escalation protocols**, so that if distress signals are detected, the system involves human support instead of leaving the senior entirely reliant on the AI.
