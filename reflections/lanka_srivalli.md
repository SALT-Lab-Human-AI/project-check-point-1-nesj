### 4–6 sentence summary (what problem, method, findings)
This qualitative study asks community‑dwelling older adults how they feel about AI helping with their health. Using three one‑hour semi‑structured interview sessions with 27 participants, the authors mapped themes onto COM‑B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation) via the Theoretical Domains Framework. Participants expressed hope mixed with caution: they saw value in AI but wanted simple, gentle interfaces, privacy that’s easy to understand, and clinicians kept in the loop. Nine domains (e.g., knowledge, skills, social influence, beliefs about capability/consequences, goals, emotion) translated into tangible design choices. Bottom line: older adults will accept AI when it feels supportive, simple, and safe—never as a replacement for human care.

### 3 insights you learned
- **Start with COM‑B basics:** clear voice prompts, large text, and “one‑tap” actions build immediate capability and motivation.  
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop is expected:** older adults want AI to assist—not decide—especially for sensitive health issues.  
- **Privacy needs plain language:** trust grows when controls are visible and explanations are human‑readable, not legalese.

### 2 limitations/risks
- Small, localized sample (n = 27) limits generalizability across cultures and tech familiarity levels.  
- Interview intentions may not equal real‑world behavior; longitudinal deployments are needed.

### 1 concrete idea this inspires for Carely
**COM‑B‑guided onboarding:** a 3‑step, voice‑guided “first‑day tour” (Capability), an optional “Invite a caregiver?” card (Opportunity), and on every sensitive feature a small **“Why Carely asked this”** explainer with a one‑tap privacy toggle (Motivation via trust).

## Paper 2 — *AI Applications to Reduce Loneliness Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review of Effectiveness and Technologies* (Healthcare, 2025)

(Open access via PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11898439/)

### 4–6 sentence summary (what problem, method, findings)
This systematic review examines whether AI actually helps older adults feel less lonely, and which approaches work best. Across nine experimental studies (six RCTs, three pre–post), the most common ingredients were **speech recognition** and **emotion recognition/simulation**, mainly embedded in **social robots**, sometimes in **voice assistants**, and once as a **digital human**. Six studies reported significant reductions in loneliness—especially those with social robots—while null results tended to be short or low‑frequency deployments. The big message is that empathy features and sustained, meaningful interactions matter more than sheer feature lists. The authors recommend longer, culturally aware deployments and mixed‑methods evaluation.

### 3 insights you learned
- **Dose matters:** companionship is a habit; frequent, longer interactions outperform “once‑in‑a‑while” use.  
- **Affective skills help:** even simple emotion detection and empathetic responses appear to mediate loneliness reductions.  
- **Form factor counts:** embodied agents (robots) often drive adherence—useful inspiration even if Carely is app‑based.

### 2 limitations/risks
- Heterogeneous interventions and outcome measures make cross‑study comparisons difficult.  
- Many studies are short; benefits could decay as novelty fades without longer follow‑ups.

### 1 concrete idea this inspires for Carely
**Companionship arcs:** design weekly themes (music reminiscence, family stories, light exercise), track mood/engagement over time, and **auto‑adjust cadence**. For example, if low mood appears ≥3× in a week, shorten chats, switch to soothing content, and notify a caregiver if the pattern persists.
