# Opportunity Framing — Carely

## Problem Context
Most AI companions for older adults are either generic chatbots that forget user context or hardware-based products like robots and tablets that are expensive and device-locked.  

They rarely combine **memory, engagement, and safety awareness** in one platform. Older adults need a simple, web/app-based AI companion that remembers routines, offers light cognitive engagement, and ensures safety through calm, context-aware interaction.

## Opportunity Summary

| Focus Area              | Current Gaps in Existing Tools                                    | What Carely Will Offer                                                                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory & Context**     | No continuity — tools forget routines and logs after sessions.   | Persistent 7-day memory for routines, moods, and reminders.                             |
| **Engagement**           | Limited interaction — few promote mental activity.               | Short puzzles, memory cues, and friendly conversation prompts to support recall/focus.  |
| **Safety Awareness**     | Tools recognize issues but don’t act safely.                     | Detects red-flag phrases (e.g., “chest pressure”) → gives calm steps → sends alert.     |
| **Reminders & Routine**  | Inconsistent reminders or multiple confusing options.            | One clear, context-based reminder at a time (e.g., medication, movement).               |
| **Caregiver Role**       | Complex dashboards or data sharing.                              | Simple caregiver alerts only when needed — no dashboard at this time.                   |
| **Accessibility**        | Hardware-bound or subscription-based solutions.                  | Web/app-based, low-cost, and easy to access from any browser.                           |

## Novelty
- **Memory + Engagement + Safety** combined in a single lightweight application.  
- **No external device or robot** — accessible directly via web or app.  
- **Simple caregiver notification system** — not a full management dashboard.

## Carely’s Promise
A **context-aware, safety-ready, and cognitively engaging AI companion** that remembers, reminds, and reassures — all within one simple, accessible application.
