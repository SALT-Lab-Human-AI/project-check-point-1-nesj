This document summarizes the prompting study experiences of **Srivalli** and **Emmima**, who explored different AI tools to evaluate their effectiveness as supportive, context-aware companions.

## Srivalli’s Study

### Tools Explored
- **Copilot**
- **NotebookLM**

### Findings
- **Copilot**
  - ✅ Strengths: Empathetic and conversational; good at handling emotional phrasing; accurate with invalid dates/times.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Struggled with logical consistency; weak contextual recall (forgot puzzle answers); provided multiple suggestions instead of step-by-step guidance; no direct links/resources (e.g., music or video URLs); lost previous conversations after a few days, including allergy info.

- **NotebookLM**
  - ✅ Strengths: Better reasoning, effective in identifying critical situations.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Neutral tone, less empathetic; no memory persistence (lost entire chat history after session closed).

### Summary
Both tools were capable of isolated task assistance but failed at **sustaining continuity and personalization**. This highlights the **need for an accessible, empathy-driven, memory-retentive AI companion** that prioritizes long-term context and safety over short, disconnected conversations.

## Emmima’s Study

### Tools Explored
- **MetaAI**
- **ChatGPT (non-pro version)**

### Findings
- **ChatGPT**
  - ✅ Strengths: Reliable for factual and task-based responses.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Lacked empathy and conversational warmth (functional, not supportive); no memory of past instructions/reminders (e.g., medication timing); no interactive redirection (YouTube links did not play directly).

- **MetaAI**
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Frequent usability issues — sessions often broke with *“something went wrong”* errors; generated random, inaccurate dates/times for past events (e.g., medication logs); no memory persistence; unreliable flow of interaction.

### Summary
While ChatGPT was **factually reliable**, it lacked warmth and continuity. MetaAI was **unreliable and contextually inaccurate**. Both tools failed to deliver the **long-term contextual memory and supportive companionship** that older adults or context-sensitive users require.
