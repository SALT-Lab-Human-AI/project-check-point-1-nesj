This document summarizes the prompting study experiences of **Srivalli** and **Emmima**, who explored different AI tools to evaluate their effectiveness as supportive, context-aware companions.

## Srivalli’s Study

### Tools Explored
- **Copilot**
- **NotebookLM**

### Findings
- **Copilot**
  - ✅ Strengths: Empathetic and conversational; good at handling emotional phrasing; accurate with invalid dates/times.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Struggled with logical consistency; weak contextual recall (forgot puzzle answers); provided multiple suggestions instead of step-by-step guidance; no direct links/resources (e.g., music or video URLs); lost previous conversations after a few days, including allergy info.

- **NotebookLM**
  - ✅ Strengths: Better reasoning, effective in identifying critical situations.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Neutral tone, less empathetic; no memory persistence (lost entire chat history after session closed).

### Summary
Both tools were capable of isolated task assistance but failed at **sustaining continuity and personalization**. This highlights the **need for an accessible, empathy-driven, memory-retentive AI companion** that prioritizes long-term context and safety over short, disconnected conversations.

## Emmima’s Study

### Tools Explored
- **MetaAI**
- **ChatGPT (non-pro version)**

### Findings
- **ChatGPT**
  - ✅ Strengths: Reliable for factual and task-based responses.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Lacked empathy and conversational warmth (functional, not supportive); no memory of past instructions/reminders (e.g., medication timing); no interactive redirection (YouTube links did not play directly).

- **MetaAI**
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Frequent usability issues — sessions often broke with *“something went wrong”* errors; generated random, inaccurate dates/times for past events (e.g., medication logs); no memory persistence; unreliable flow of interaction.

### Summary
While ChatGPT was **factually reliable**, it lacked warmth and continuity. MetaAI was **unreliable and contextually inaccurate**. Both tools failed to deliver the **long-term contextual memory and supportive companionship** that older adults or context-sensitive users require.

## Jasmitha's Study

### Tools Explored

- **Kimi**
- **Perplexity**

### Findings

- **Kimi**
- ✅ Strengths: Provides concise and structured responses.
- ❌ Weaknesses: Lacks empathy and emotional tone; no reminders or calling ability; gives false confirmations; mood tracking inaccurate (reported 7 days when only 3 were logged).

- **Perplexity**
- ✅ Strengths: Uses a better, more natural tone; provides detailed, informative replies; can share relevant resource links (e.g., music).
- ❌ Weaknesses: Asks excessive follow-up questions without independent reasoning; unable to execute actions directly (only shares links, doesn’t play media).

### Summary

Perplexity show potential for informational assistance but fall short in emotional intelligence, autonomous action, and reliability. Kimi was lacking in almost many cases. These gaps reinforce the need for our Elderly AI Companion to combine empathy, decision-making, and genuine contextual awareness for a more supportive user experience.
