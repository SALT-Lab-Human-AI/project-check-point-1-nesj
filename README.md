# Senior Care Companion ‚Äì AI-based Memory & Wellness Support (Carely)

## üìù Problem Statement
Many seniors face loneliness, forgetfulness, and difficulty managing daily routines. Traditional care models focus on physical well-being but often overlook emotional support, cognitive stimulation, and proactive assistance. With limited caregiver availability, there is a strong need for an accessible, AI-driven companion that ensures seniors feel supported, engaged, and safe every day.

## üéØ Target Users & Core Tasks

### Users
- **Seniors living alone or with minimal caregiver presence**: Desire a simple, conversational interface for companionship and daily assistance.  
- **Family caregivers**: Want peace of mind and proactive alerts about their loved one's well-being.  
- **Care facilities**: Seek digital tools to augment staff capacity, automate check-ins, and gather non-intrusive wellness data.  

### Core Tasks
- Daily check-ins (‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?‚Äù)  
- Sentiment & intent detection (detect ‚Äúsad‚Äù, ‚Äúconfused‚Äù, ‚Äúurgent‚Äù)  
- Routine reminders (medications, appointments, meals)  
- Personalized engagement (recommending devotional songs, stories, light exercises)  
- Escalations (alert caregiver if urgent condition detected)  
- Memory cues (remind names of family members or important dates)

## üîç Competitive Landscape

### Existing Solutions
- **Voice assistants (Alexa, Google Home)** ‚Äì broad but not senior-focused, lack personalization.  
- **Care apps** ‚Äì task-oriented, often designed for caregivers, interfaces complex for seniors.  
- **Wearables** ‚Äì track physical data but lack conversational/emotional support.  

### Shortcomings
- **Poor Personalization**: Fail to adapt to individual senior needs, language, or history.  
- **Limited Emotional Intelligence**: Cannot detect subtle changes in mood or tone.  
- **Lack of Proactive Nudging**: Passive, waiting for commands instead of engaging.  
- **No Holistic Integration**: Siloed solutions, not combining reminders, emotional support, and caregiver insights.
